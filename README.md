# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Drugs-Side-Effects-and-Medical-Conditions-Project-in-Python
Analyzed drug data using Python, Excel, and NLP to uncover side effects, ratings, and prescription patterns. Delivered actionable insights to improve drug efficacy, reduce adverse effects, and optimize patient satisfaction.

Description:
In this project, I explored a comprehensive pharmaceutical dataset (2,931 records, 17 attributes) to uncover relationships between medications, side effects, user ratings, and medical conditions. The business need was to improve drug efficacy, patient satisfaction, and safety by identifying key factors influencing user feedback.

üîç Objective:
To analyze user ratings, pregnancy risks, side effects, and prescription categories (Rx vs. OTC) to provide strategic insights to pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers.

üß† Approach:
Cleaned and preprocessed data using Excel and Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
Used NLP techniques to tokenize medical condition descriptions.
Created visualizations to identify:
Top-rated drugs and most frequent side effects
Impact of pregnancy risk categories on satisfaction
Comparison of Rx vs. OTC ratings
Drug class vs. rating performance

üìä Key Insights:
Headache, nausea, and dizziness are the most reported side effects.
Category A drugs showed the highest average ratings.
OTC drugs had lower satisfaction, likely due to mild efficacy.
Antibiotics and chronic illness medications outperformed others in satisfaction.

‚úÖ Outcome:
This analysis enabled better understanding of pharmaceutical effectiveness, helping recommend safer formulations, enhanced OTC performance, and targeted improvements to reduce adverse effects and optimize user trust.
